# Avery Organic Farms

## React CSS Lesson

**This was a very quick exercise to work with React and various CSS methods to create a site with the given criteria:**

"Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce, and sells it at Farmer's Markets throughout town. Since they're at a different market almost every day they thought it would be helpful to start a website so customers can see which location they'll be at when.

They also grow different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too.

Using React and all other tools we've covered so far, create an aesthetically-pleasing site that depicts this information. The data you'll use is in the Cheat Sheet section of this lesson. Also, take time to construct your entire environment from scratch; it's important to practice these fundamentals before we increase the complexity of our projects later this week!"
